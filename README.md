<h1>🐈 Greetings, Fellow Developer! I'm Rafael</h1>
<h2>Come closer and take a sit!</h2>

<p>
  In this vast landscape of code and logic, I walk the path of <b>Node.js</b>, crafting backends and API's  
  I bring some ideas to life with, while <b>C++</b> sharpens my understanding of systems and performance.  
  Reach out on LinkedIn to share knowledge or collaborate on something meaningful.
</p>

<p>
  May your path through the realms of programming be insightful and rewarding. Scroll onward, and you shall glimpse an image and some truths about me.
