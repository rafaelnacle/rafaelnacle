<h1>⚗ Greetings, Fellow Alchemist! I'm Rafael</h1>
<h2>Shall we transmute ideas into living code with Elixir?</h2>

<p>
  In this vast landscape of code and logic, I walk the path of <b>Elixir</b>, weaving concurrent processes as if they were countless little flames dancing in harmony.  
  With <b>Phoenix</b>, ideas take flight and rise resilient, like the mythic bird reborn from fire.  
  Reach out through LinkedIn or message, to share your wisdom or to build together.

<p>
  May your path through the realms of programming be insightful and rewarding. Scroll onward, and you shall glimpse an image and some truths about me.
